#### My words

This is my self-study project, and I learned a lot of programming concepts while developing Afiya. I want to host Afiya on the cloud, but I encountered this error.

![error screenshot](https://github.com/HashanSudeera/afiya/blob/e7ed2b2a0ec056a3a66d95fe5566f63a68f62e7d/img/IMG_20250123_131356.jpg)


This error is occurring in the Python yt-dlp module. I tried manually adding YouTube authorization cookies, but it's not working.

If you'd like to help me fix this problem, please let me know. I want to learn how to resolve it.

I found another way to solve this problem. We can use a YouTube API key, which allows the code to be deployed. However, it's not free.
